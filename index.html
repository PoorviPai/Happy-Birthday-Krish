    <h1>Happy Birthday Krish</h1>
    <h2>Krish today is your special day.Today a best friend,a supporter,a brother and a person who encourages everyone to be themselves was born.Let us explain why we said so.We said your a best friend because when we need you,you will always be there by our side and never let us down.A supporter because when ever we felt that we should just follow a path and not be creative you have encouraged us and always given your best to do so.A brother because whenever we miss our cousins.You will always come and give the same feeling that they would.A person who encourages everyone because you always encourage everyone to do what they like.Many friends leave their true friends for some other friend but when you have a new friend you make sure you are giving equal importance to everyone.Thank you for being who you are in our lives.This is something that we did for your special day.We are lucky to have a friend like you and Rishi is very lucky to have a brother like you.All be yourself and we know you will always be a best friend.</h2>
